###### The Problem: 
Bookshelves in our homes contain the world’s knowledge but they remain underutilized and inaccessible for many readers. 
The Internet has opened a whole new arena for  eReaders taking 35% of the book market. While print books are abundant, their price remains higher than ebooks.<br/>
<br/>

###### The Goal: 
Design a Book Sharing Library website to be user friendly by providing clear navigation and offering a fast checkout process.<br/>
<br/>

###### Tasks: 

- Ideate the product, 
- Create user stories and break down the project to tasks using Asana. 
- Research and Conduct Interviews
- Design mockups and build prototypes
- Build the initial MVP using React js and AWS Amplify

<br/>
<br/>

##### User Research Summary
I conducted user interviews, which I then turned into empathy maps to better understand the target user and their needs. I discovered that books they possessed elements of emotional attachment and revered as items of value amongst book lovers.

“You are not done with a book until you pass it to another reader.” - Donalyn Miller



##### User Research Pain Points

-  Community: Book Apps focus on bookselling and less in building a community of book lovers. 
-  
- Environmental Impact: Users state they would like to discover more sustainable options for reading and reducing their carbon footprint. 
- Book Availability: Millions of books stay unread in bookshelves while millions book readers have limited reading options in their bookshelves.

##### User Journey Map

I created a user journey map of Jackie’s experience using the site to help identify possible pain points and improvement opportunities.

##### Sitemap

My goal here was to make strategic information architecture decisions that work for a rapid developed MVP and that are scalable in the future.

##### Low Fidelity Prototype


To create a low-fidelity prototype, I connected all of the screens involved in the primary user flow of adding an item to the cart and checking out.

At this point, I had received feedback on my designs from members of my team about things like placement of buttons and page organization. I made sure to listen to their feedback, and I implemented several suggestions in places that addressed user pain points. 

Moving from paper to digital wireframes made it easy to understand how the redesign could help address user pain points and improve the user experience. 

Prioritizing useful button locations and visual element placement on the home page was a key part of my strategy.

##### Usability Study
I conducted 1 round of usability study which helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups.

** Findings** : 
 - When Selecting a book users wanted to know the book condition. 
 - Users weren’t able to easily  have a book preview and sample its contents.
 - Users wanted a way to quickly save or share a book from the card.


##### Key Mockups 

Based on the insights from the usability study, I made changes to improve the site’s checkout flow. One of the changes I made was adding the option to select one of the copies available This allowed users more freedom to pick their book and how much they are paying for shipping.

I included considerations for additional screen sizes in my mockups based on my earlier wireframes.

##### High Fidelity Prototype 

My hi-fi prototype followed the same user flow as the lo-fi prototype, and included the design changes made after the usability study, as well as several changes. I created two different personas and build two prototypes one for Give a Book and one for Get a Book flow to emulate a more real life situation.

##### Accesibility Consideration

 - Provided access to users who are vision impaired through adding alt text to images for screen readers.
 - Used icons to help make navigation easier.
 - Used detailed imagery for frames and art to help all users better understand the product.

<br/>


##### Takeaways 

**Impact:**
Our target users shared that the app was intuitive and responded to the reader’s needs for circulating, discussing and reading books. Most users shared that they will give Bookworm a try when it is launched.

<br/>

**What I learned:** 
I learned that UI kits such as material UI allow for fast iterations from both UX UI and also Developer perspective especially in a small team. Being a one person team I wanted  to focus on the real needs of the user when coming up with design ideas and solutions in order to produce an MVP.

<br/>
<br/>

##### Next steps 
- Build a  Frontend React Application and integrate Google Books API. 
- Work on the social aspect of the app adding Bookclubs and user interactions
