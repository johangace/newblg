<br/>

 **Tools:** Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Miro, Balsamiq, Evernote
<br/>
<br/>

###### Summary: 

Nifty is platform for displaying NFTS in the real world through. Nifty strives to connect art lovers with NFT owners, artists and creators who can monetize on their product.

###### The Problem: 
The NFT art is largely contained in owner’s crypto wallets and marketplaces without a medium for display in the physical world.
<br/>
<br/>

###### The Goal: 
Design an app that allows art lovers to purchase NFT art copies for display and help NFT owners monetize on their products.
<br/>
<br/>

###### Responsibilities: 
Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, and iterating on designs.

<br/>
<br/>

##### User Research Summary
I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group identified through research was art patrons of modern art.

This user group confirmed initial assumptions about Niftsy users, but research also revealed that the NFT art industry is an unfamiliar territory for many art lovers. We build Niftsy as a way to bridge the traditional physical forms of art with the new digital art medium. Other user problems included interests, or challenges that make it difficult to display and acquire art.



##### User Research Pain Points

-  Price: NFT market is hot with art from top artists selling for millions of dollars.
-  NFT Education: NFT is a Platforms for purchasing art and NFTs are not equipped with learning tools for users. Research reveals that only 6% of potential users have exposure to NFTs.
-  Lack of crypto Wallets: There are only 70 million active Ethereal wallets in the world today which leaves  billions of users outside of the new art revolution.

##### User Journey Map

Mapping Leah’s user journey revealed how helpful it would be for  users to have access to a dedicated NFT to frame app.

##### User Journey Flow

##### Paper Wireframes

Taking the time to draft iterations of each screen of the app on paper ensured that the elements that made it to digital wireframes would be well-suited to address user pain points. For the home screen, I prioritized a categories to help users find art see more art pieces they are interested in.

##### Low Fidelity Prototype

As the initial design phase continued, I made sure to base screen designs on feedback and findings from  the user research.
Easy navigation was a key user need to address in the designs in addition to equipping the app to work with assistive technologies.

Easy navigation was a key user need to address in the designs in addition to equipping the app to work with assistive technologies.

Using the completed set of digital wireframes, I created a low-fidelity prototype. After research I improved the initial prototype. The primary user flow I connected was creating and buying an art piece, so the prototype could be used in a usability study.

##### Usability Study
I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what aspects of the mockups needed refining. 

**Round 1 Findings** : 
 - Users want to see related items
 - Users want more customization options
 - Users would like an option to create a crypto wallet within the app


**Round 2 Findings** : 
 - Users want to learn more about the NFT art world and their usage
 - Art lovers want more options to embed art in the physics world (merchandise, tech products, digital screens)


##### Key Mockups 

Early designs allowed users to learn more about individual NFTs but I added more information about the token, owner and related information.  I also revised the design so users see the information vertically instead of navigating through horizontal tab. 

The usability study revealed that users want to explore related items so I created Collections.
Another key finding is the desire to learn more about NFTs as art medium. News section was added along with introductory learning snippets into the NFT world.

##### High Fidelity Prototype 

The final high-fidelity prototype presented cleaner user flows for creating and art frame.  It also met user needs for viewing more related items and exploring new categories.

##### Accesibility Considerations

 - Provided access to users who are vision impaired through adding alt text to images for screen readers.
 - Used icons to help make navigation easier.
 - Used detailed imagery for frames and art to help all users better understand the product.

<br/>


##### Takeaways 


**Impact:**
The app facilitates a connection between web2 and web3 by bringing the innovative NFT art in users homes and helping a new generation of digital artists connect with their fans. 

<br/>

**What I learned:** 
While designing the Niftsy app, I reiterated multiple times shaping it to a useful produt for artist and art fans. Looking back it makes me realize that good design is a journey without a known end and it gave me courage to explore ideas outside of the box.

<br/>
<br/>

##### Next steps 
- I am creating a  proof of concept React.js App.
- Connect a third party Art supplier API to test the idea.
- Conduct more user research to determine any possibility for breaking into new art mediums.
