###### The Problem: 
 Remittance payments have been a well known issue for immigrants and their families. These payments are slow costly and infeasible for many citizens.  About 400 Million euros are brought in Albania from Immigrants and about 25% of the population has benefited from remittances. The average remittance payment costs about 7-8% of the amount. Companies such as Western Union offer cash solutions but they have not adapted a viable digital payment solution. Allowing cross border payments will be the first opening to democratizing digital payments in Albania.


###### The Solution: 
Our solution eliminates financial institutions, the difficulties of Albanians to send money cross borders and offers a simple way for receivers of the remittances to accept use it on digital purchases and later brick and mortar merchants. Leapfrog removes  the difficulties of Albanians to obtain a credit card and the offers a simple way for  merchants to accept payments.

###### Value Proposition: 
1. Cross border  and P2P payments are expensive an ineffective in Albania. Leapfrog enables users to send money to each other in seconds. 
2. Mobile payments are almost non-existent  while the smartphone adoption is high. Albanians can be part of the rising digital economy by completing payments, purchasing online, and transfering money cross border .
