###### The Problem: 
 Remittance payments in Albania are slow, costly and infeasible for many citizens. About 25% of the population is a beneficiary of these payments and  the average transaction fee costs about 7-8% of the amount. Some companies offer cash solution but the digital payments are almost inexistent. 
<br/>
<br/>

###### The Solution: 
1. Leapfrog removes the difficulties of Albanians for  obtaining a card and offers a simple way for  merchants to accept card payments.
2. Leapfrog offers an easy solution for Albanians to send money cross borders. 
<br/>
<br/>

###### Value Proposition: 
1. Cross border  and P2P payments are expensive an ineffective in Albania. Leapfrog enables users to send money to each other in seconds. 
2. Mobile payments are almost non-existent  while the smartphone adoption is high. Albanians can be part of the rising digital economy by completing payments, purchasing online, and transfering money cross border .

##### User Research Summary
User research was conducted through interviews with three types of users. Merchants who accept payments, immigrants who send remittance payments and likely beneficiaries of remittances.  
Selected users: 
- I focused on the bankless population of Albania. Data revealed that more than half of Albanians do not have a bank account. 
- For the purposes of this study I selected users are in possession of and have basic knowledge of a smartphone.  Data shows that about 75% of the Albanian population has access to a smartphone.
<br/>
##### Pain Points
 1.  Remitance Payments: The average cost of a remittance transfer is 7-8% which was rated as Too High from users. 
 2. Lack of Bank Accounts
 3. Lack of a cryptocurrency exchange network operating in Albania. There are no cryptocurrency wallets serving in Albania currently. Binance, and Coinbase have not yet extended their services. 
 4. No viable Electronic Payment solutions: Through interviews it was revealed that most users do not have a way for processing an online transaction online.
